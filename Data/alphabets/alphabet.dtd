<!-- Text output: -->
<!ELEMENT textCharAction EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST textCharAction unicode CDATA #IMPLIED> <!-- If the Unicode value is unspecified, the label will be used to determine it. If the label is empty or consists of more than one character, an error will be thrown. -->

<!ELEMENT deleteTextAction EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST deleteTextAction range CDATA #REQUIRED> <!-- Can be "char|word|sentence|line|paragraph|all" -->

<!ELEMENT moveTextCaretAction EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST moveTextCaretAction target CDATA #REQUIRED> <!-- Can be "(previous|next) (char|word|sentence|line|paragraph)", or "start" or "end" -->

<!-- Text-to-Speech: -->

<!ELEMENT contextTTSAction EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST contextTTSAction range CDATA #REQUIRED> <!-- Reads out the current char|word|sentence|line|paragraph|all -->

<!ELEMENT changeAlphabetAction EMPTY>
<!ELEMENT changeAlphabetAction alphabetName CDATA #REQUIRED> <!-- Switches Dasher to the given alphabet -->

<!-- A general action that could be used to change any Dasher setting could look like this, but probably is way too complicated and not that useful:
<!ELEMENT changeSettingAction EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST changeSettingAction settingName CDATA #REQUIRED> <!- Stringname of the setting ->
<!ATTLIST changeSettingAction doValue CDATA #IMPLIED> <!- New value of the setting in case of selection ->
<!ATTLIST changeSettingAction undoValue CDATA #IMPLIED> <!- New value of the setting in case of deselection ->
-->

<!-- System/application control: -->
<!-- These two actions enable triggering any action in an application that can be bound to a keyboard shortcut or is accessible
     via accessibility services like the Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI). Anything else probably isn't technically feasible. -->
<!ELEMENT accessibilityAction EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST accessibilityAction doAction CDATA #REQUIRED> <!-- Sends the specified AT-SPI action to the currently focused application -->
<!ATTLIST accessibilityAction undoAction CDATA #REQUIRED> <!-- Sends the specified AT-SPI action to the currently focused application -->

<!ELEMENT keyboardAction EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST keyboardAction key CDATA #IMPLIED> <!-- Emulates a keyboard shortcut, possibly with several modifiers, given as keyboard scancodes divided by commas (e.g. "1d,38,e053" for Ctrl+Alt+Entf), performing a press and a release -->
<!ATTLIST keyboardAction press CDATA #IMPLIED> <!-- As above, but only performing the press -->
<!ATTLIST keyboardAction release CDATA #IMPLIED> <!-- As above, but only performing the release -->
<!ATTLIST keyboardAction undoKey CDATA #IMPLIED> <!-- Emulates a keyboard shortcut, possibly with several modifiers, given as keyboard scancodes divided by commas (e.g. "1d,38,e053" for Ctrl+Alt+Entf), performing a press and a release -->
<!ATTLIST keyboardAction undoPress CDATA #IMPLIED> <!-- As above, but only performing the press -->
<!ATTLIST keyboardAction undoRelease CDATA #IMPLIED> <!-- As above, but only performing the release -->

<!-- External actions: -->
<!-- Similar to the socket input option, this action enables connecting Dasher to other accessibility tools, sending messages that the other tool can process. 
     The sent messages are implicitly terminated with a newline character, unless suppressNewline is "true".-->
<!ELEMENT socketOutputAction EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST socketOutputAction doString CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ATTLIST socketOutputAction undoString CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ATTLIST socketOutputAction suppressNewline CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- Especially for the last two, it probably makes sense to add a windowTitle attribute to nodes: -->
<!-- <node label="New Tab" windowTitle=".*(Firefox|Chrome|Edge).*" fixedProbability="0.02"> Only shows this node if the title of the currently focused window matches the given regex. -->
<!--   <accessibilityAction doAction="NewTab" undoAction="CloseTab"/> -->
<!-- </node> -->
