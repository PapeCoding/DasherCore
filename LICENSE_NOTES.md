## Terminology

'We' - This document represents the views of the ['dasher-project'](https://github.com/dasher-project) [(stewarded by Ace Centre)](https://github.com/dasher-project/governance), importantly not the Inference group.

## Credits

First of all its important to give important credit to the people who originally developed Dasher. Dasher was developed by the Inference Group in Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge.

> David MacKay's group works on machine learning and information theory. Current projects involve neural networks, automated Go playing, the design of record-breaking error-correcting codes and quantum error-correcting codes, and the construction of human-computer interfaces that make use of adaptive language models.

At the time Dasher was a ground breaking development in text entry using continuous gestures and to this day it is still seen as the most effective way to enter text using continuous gestures. All of this is thanks to David MacKay and his hard working team.

[You can see an archive of the groups website here.](http://www.inference.org.uk/is/). The inference group are in the process of setting up a consultation body which will contribute to the further development of Dasher

## Original License

Dasher was originally shared with a GPL license.

[You can still use the fully GPL version here.](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dasher). This version has been carefully maintained by Patrick Welche since its creation.

## GPL / MIT

GPL is a copy left license, meaning:

> Permissions of this strong copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license. - [Choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)

MIT is permissive, meaning:

> A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code. - [Choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

## Why did we want to change the license?

## How did we change the license?

## Why didn't we do a copyright transfer?

Whilst we were gaining permission we could have asked copyright holders to transfer their copyright to a central entity allowing us to change the license in the future. However, we chose not to do this as we feel this fundamentally goes against the idea of open source. For the same reason we don't ask contributors to transfer copyright.

## Long term goal

Right now there are two versions of Dasher in development and maintenance. One is this version which is MIT licensed and the other is GPL licensed.

We would like to bring these to codebases together somehow. We are not quite what that looks like isn't totally clear right now but that is the long term goal.
